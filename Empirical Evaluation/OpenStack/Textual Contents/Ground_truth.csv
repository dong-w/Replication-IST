1,Use constraints for api-ref environment,"Use constraints for api-ref environment

Change [1] updated tox.ini to use constraints rather than
specific, non-constrained install commands but neglected
to update the api-ref environment.  In addition to fixing
that omission we also remove a bit of ugly trailing
whitespace.

This will make it easier to do out-of-band cleanup of Rally-created
resources. It eliminates the ability for scenarios to specify a custom
random name length, ensures that the random name prefix always starts
with ""rally_"", and includes a random part that consists of four
hyphen-delimited sets of four random characters.

This also deprecates the Scenario._generate_random_name() function;
all random names will be generated according to the same format to
limit the likelihood of leaking misnamed resources.

since the is_null function is specific to the APIVersionRequest and
it's only checking if it's values are None as well.

This patch contains 2 backports from master. Unfortunately, an update on
f21 is forcing to update the requirements for amqp1. Therefore, we need
these 2 commits, which depend on each other, to be backported as one.

Commit 1:

Enable amqp's protocol unit tests everywhere

Now that python-qpid-proton has taken an approach similar to zmq's, it's
possible to install it in boxes where the C libraries are not present in
the system. This patch takes advantage of that to enable amqp protocol's
tests everywhere.

Note that the backport was modified to match the stable/kilo gate
configuration. This job, in Kilo, is supposed to run *just* on f21,
therefore, I've removed the changes to the tox.ini to avoid installing
the dependencies everywhere.

Till that moment it was possible to use Generic driver only with Neutron.
Nova network still is used in various deployments, so add support for it.

List of changes:
- Split service_instance to two parts - compute and networking.
- Implement networking part as 'network helpers'.
- Add new config option 'service_instance_network_helper_type' that supports
only two values - 'nova' and 'neutron' respectively.
It is required option. Default value is 'neutron'.

Details on Nova-network approach:
- Due to resctrictions of Nova network, where security group rules are applied
to all VM network interfaces, no need to create service network, because it
will be just duplication. Service instance will use only one network that is
provided within share-network entity.
- Host of manila-share service should have network connectivity for all
networks, that are going to be used for share creations.
- Nova network helper does not create resources, so, network is not configured
by Manila in that case. So, network infrastructure can be either flat or using
VLAN segmentation as well.

libraries is not a good one. In fact, it's a completely and total
disaster which shows clearly the work of a bunch of provicial-minded
people who don't know how to cooperate or admit that someone else might
have a different opinion.

Nonetheless, thus is the world in which we actually exist, theory of how
things should be notwithstanding. We were requested by the distros to
stop managing our own apt repos, so we install our depends via pip now.
Additionally, we now actually even GATE on the pip requirements list.
That means that the requirements list that indicates packages from PyPI
is the absolute and total list of requirements in the form that we can
manage.

Thus - installing those packages also via apt is a not only a waste of

both positional arguments and options not disctinguished. The
positional arguments are supposed to be enclosed in angular braces <>,
and the options must be enclosed in square braces [].

fedora23 job is quite often taking the full 3 hours to timeout and

There are multiple contributing factors:

* fedora23 is on non performance nodes (reason unknown)
* as such it only has 4 cores, so tempest is only running 2 way
* there is no wheel cache, so 13 minutes are spent installing python packages
* rpm package installation runs nearly 8 minutes

Various of these should be addressed and get the timing under control
in experimental before we move it back to check.

 ""deleted"" column type is boolean before this fix.
 Boolean is represented as TINYINT which can store at max 127.

When using db2 as the database backend, it encounters problem
when running db_sync in step 039 due to ""SQL0669N  A system
required index cannot be dropped explicitly"", which need to
drop the constraint first then recreate the index. And this
patch also fixes the problem of dropping some indexes which
only are created in non-db2 databases, meanwhile, it will not
break the logic for all other database backends.

Associating servers or ports with neutron networks actually creates a

added subnet properties to our resources so that template authors can
model the actual dependency in the template.

This change specifies that the server refer to the subnet as well as
the network to avoid the race where the subnet has not been created
yet.

The subnet property has been available since Liberty for
OS::Nova::Server, so I think its time we considered deprecating the
network property.

The stop_process is called from grenade test cases, but

https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo-incubator/+bug/1446583

This patch adds a feature to wait for a service to stop and
sends second SIGTERM to forsibly kill the service.

The wait is up to 10 seconds because sometimes a service
takes a while to shutdown. This logic is already implemented
grenade/inc/upgrade, this pach ported the logic into
devstack script.

Also some components have a feature to shutdown their service
gracefully. In this case, the service might not stop within
10 seconds, therefore this patch also adds sending SIGTERM
to forsibly kill the service again.

Neutron can delete a port without nova being aware of it.
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/178666/ added a event to notify nova
when a port is deleted. This patch will process the event and detach
the interface.

If nuetorn<->nova event reporting is not turned on or lost for some
reason, the deleted port can be discovered during the periodic refresh
of info cache where network_info is saved. And obsolete ports can be
discovered and detached.

Note that when a port is deleted by Neutron, it's possible that the
periodic refresh is just taking place ahead of receiving the
network-vif-deleted event.

In any case, the port will be detached from the instance, and the
normal flow of cleaning up due to port delete will take place.

234,Fix swap-volume for non-admin users,"Fix swap-volume for non-admin users

Cinder's volume migration API is, by default, an admin-only operation.
This includes the migrate_volume_completion API.

When Cinder is doing a volume migration, it calls Nova's swap-volume
API to detach the old volume that we're migrating from and attach
the volume that we're migrating to. Then Nova calls Cinder's
migrate_volume_completion API to signal Nova is done and Cinder
can finish the volume migration.

The problem is that swap-volume is not an admin-only API in Nova
per the default policy. So if a non-admin user tries to perform
a swap-volume operation, it will fail with a 403 when calling
Cinder's migrate_volume_completion API, since that requires an
admin user.

The simple fix here is to detect that the volumes are being migrated
and only call Cinder's migrate_volume_completion API if that's
the case. We can determine this by checking the 'migration_status'
value on the volume (old or new, it doesn't matter, I chose the
old volume here). Note that the volume migration_status is only
provided in the volume details for an admin context, which is the
case for the volume migration operation where Cinder is calling
Nova to do the swap-volume operation. In the non-admin user
swap-volume case, we won't see the volume migration_status and
simply assume the old volume isn't being migrated and we don't
call migrate_volume_completion.

287,HA integration tests,"HA integration tests

To better check HA, integration tests (where actual processes are used
together with one another, as opposed to functional tests which only
check functions) are needed. This sets the ground-works of such tests:

* Define different qr/qg device names, based on the last 3 letters of
  the 'host' defined for the agent. This is done because if we have
  2 l3-agent instances, each will use the same qr/qg device names
  during creation, but only one port can be created at a time.
* Since 2 l3 agents are run at the same time, one may not be aware of
  the other's namespace and will try to delete it. Now, each agent
  will only attempt to delete namespaces with 'host' at the end of the
  namespace's name.
* Created neutron-l3-test-agent executeable to be used by future
  integration tests

307,Update cells blacklist regex for test_server_basic_ops,"Update cells blacklist regex for test_server_basic_ops

Tempest change 9bee3b92f1559cb604c8bd74dcca57805a85a97a
renamed a test in our blacklist so update the filter to
handle the old and new name.

The Tempest team is hesitant to revert the change so we
should handle it ourselves and eventually move to using
test uuids for our blacklist, but there might need to
be work in devstack-gate for that first.

Conflicts:

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict is due to the regex using

The first step to port Trove to Python 3 is to have a working

This change creates such minimum test environment just by running 3

However murano-dashboard (unlike horizon) does not use a shell file to
run it's tests, instead relying on tox.

This change does not actually run the jobs, we need to have a repo
for testing that the new consolidated setup works, so getting this in
