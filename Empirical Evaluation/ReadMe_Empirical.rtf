\f0\fs24 \cf0 This file refers to the Empirical Evaluation.\
\
The file includes three main folders for each studied project: Qt, Android, OpenStack.\
\
Under each project, we divided it into two such as Textual Contents and File Location folder.\
\
Here I would like to introduce detailed information for one project : Android.\
\
Under Android/Textual Contents, it has three excel files:\
\
**************************************************************\
In Testing_data excel, it has two columns:\
\
Testing_Id: refers to the index number in the sql dataset as mentioned in the ReadMe_Exploratory\
\
Title: refers to the title information of testing patches\
\
Message: refers to the message information of testing patches\
\
In Training_data excel, it has two columns:\
\
Training_Id: For the positive one (linked patches), refers to the target patch of the link. The number here is consistent with the online page and is not the index number in the sql dataset. For the negative one (non-linked patches), refers to the index number in the sql dataset\
\
Title: refers to the title information of training patches\
