    use git clone --branch instead of --no-checkout

    git submodule update does not cause an actual checkout if HEAD matches
    the recorded submodule sha1 even if it was not actually checked out.

    it would be possible to work around this by calling git checkout HEAD in
    each submodule if no files are checked out, but that seems hacky.

    instead, just make the module cloning already check out the desired
    branch. this produces checkouts that are within a few commits of the
    final sha1, so isn't too bad.

22,Improve handling of XRandR events in XCB backend,"Improve handling of XRandR events in XCB backend

Querying X server for data can be very expensive, especially when there
are multiple processes querying it at the same time (which is exactly what
happens when screen configuration changes and all Qt applications receive
XRandR change notifications). This patch is aiming to reduce the number of
queries to X server as much as possible by making use of detailed information
available in the RRCrtcChangeNotify and RROutputChangeNotify events.

Firstly, the backend now does not rebuild all QXcbScreens on any change (which
involved the very expensive xcb_randr_get_screen_resources() call), but only
builds the full set of QXcbScreens once in initializeScreens(), and then just
incrementally updates it.

Secondly, it avoids querying X server for all screens geometry as much as
possible, and only does so when CRTC/Output change notification for a particular
screen is delivered.

As a result, handling of all XRandR events on screen change is reduced from tens
of seconds to less then a seconds and applications are better responsive after
that, because we don't block the event loop for long. The X server is also more
responsive after the screen change, since we are not overloading it with requests.

On my platform (Archlinux, libxcb 1.11-1) and a recent build of Qt dev
I noticed that writing anything to a QLineEdit was broken, as not only
the character for the pressed key was inserted, but also what looks
like whitespace. A simple debug program showed that a ""\u0000"" is
appended to every character in the QString text associated with a
QKeyEvent, which brought me to QXcbKeyboard::lookupString.

There, the size of the buffer is returned as 1 and apparently that
is also the amount of chars written to in the QByteArray buffer. There
is no '\x00' char at the end, but rather a literal char(0), potentially
from the default-initialization in the QByteArray::resize call.
This then gets included in the QString following the QString::fromUtf8
conversion.

By leveraging the size returned by the xcb API and passing that to
QString::fromUtf8 we can prevent this problem from arising.

I believe this might also be a bug in XCB, but this patch in Qt should
never be incorrect and being explicit seems to help in my situation.

plugins don't know about widgets.

Change the Cocoa touch implementation to send single-point touch events
to QWidgetWindow windows only. Make QApplication forward single-point
touch events only if the target widget has the
Qt::WA_TouchPadAcceptSingleTouchEvents attribute set.

This now guarantees that doing a round-trip from an FP number to string
and back to number results in the same number. This change is required
because DBL_DIG and FLT_DIG don't have the meaning that we were
expecting them to, here: they mean the minimum number of digits of
precision in decimal (i.e., changing the last decimal will always cause
the FP number to change). We need the maximum number: there is one
change in the last decimal place that causes the FP number to change.

IEEE 754 single-precision has 24 binary digits and double precision has
53 binary digits in their mantissa. To convert that to decimal, multiply
by the number of decimal digits a binary digit represents (log2(10) =
0.3), then add one for the rounding and one more digit for the actual
precision we want. That is, for floats we now ask for 9 digits and for
double, 17 decimal digits.

enables C++11 by default, which leads to a Qt build
that uses both standard libraries. This is something
we would like to avoid.

The original test works if
   1) QMdiArea stays active after calling showMinimized, then showNormal.
   2) or showNormal results in a QShowEvent when unminimizing.

1 doesn't apply, because the window manager activates a different window
when minimizing.
2 doesn't apply, because going from minimized to normal doesn't change
the visibility of the window and thus doesn't send a QShowEvent.

on Android (like services), but until then, we need to hardcore the
dependency on Qt Gui to make sure these autotests run properly.

142,xcb: Use XIGrabDevice instead of xcb_grab_pointer with XI 2.2,"xcb: Use XIGrabDevice instead of xcb_grab_pointer with XI 2.2

Switch to using the pointer events from XI2 when touch is available (i.e.
version is >= 2.2). This allows us to select and grab the button and motion
events together with the touch ones. This prevents the issue of not getting
touch events when grabbing via the plain xcb functions.

After all the plumbing and recabling of things the result is much cleaner than
before since now the pointer and touch events, which influence each other in
certain ways anyhow, are handled on the same unified path. The xcb-only path for
pointer events are not changed - that functions as before when XI 2.2+ is not
available.

To prevent touch sequences from being replayed after ungrabbing (for example after
dismissing a popup that caused a grab), we try to accept touches via XIAllowTouchEvents.
Unfortunately this leads to a deadlock and therefore we can only do it when we know
we have a new enough libXi. This is a configure time check which is not ideal since
the system on which apps run can have a newer libXi than the machine that did the Qt
build, but seems like the best we can do.

The environment variable QT_XCB_NO_XI2_MOUSE can be set to 1 in order to prevent
processing mouse events through XInput. This restores the old behavior with broken
grabbing.

Related to commit 5494dc7bff733 which fixes QTBUG-39858
but introduces a new side-effect using the same
Qt-creator plugin like in the bugreport.

Problem is that the context is invalidated but not
destroyed and hence not recreated after hide+show
what results in

QQuickWidget: render scenegraph with no context
at QQuickWidgetPrivate::renderSceneGraph

The working solution is to also proper destroy
the context on QQuickWidget::hideEvent like done at
other places too. Then on QQuickWidget::showEvent
the context is recreated and then proper rendered.

When content dimensions change in a ScrollView, ScrollViewHelper copies
those properties and updates the scroll bar, taking care to avoid
recursion. Because those properties were copied one-by-one, bindings
could be evaluated repeatedly.

This meant that the maximumValue was briefly calculated with a new
contentHeight and an old originY, and the current value would be bounded
to that result. In some cases, that resulted in the view's position
jumping erratically while scrolling.

Putting these layout properties inside an object allows updating them
'atomically', with a single evaluation of bindings.

The test loads an image from a remote source and it has a QSignalSpy installed

number of times the signal is emitted and expects it to hit an exact value.
That seems wrong when loading an image over the network, as we have no control
over in what pieces the data arrives on our end. And as it turns out, the test
occasionally fails in the CI system, which is also reproducible.

To stabilize the test, we now expect at least two emissions of the signal when
loading from the network (0% and 100%) but there may be more (0% 10% 80% 100%
for example). In addition the reload case is simplified by resetting the spy
and verifying that progressChanged was not emitted at all.
